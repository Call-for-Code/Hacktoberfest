**Police & Judicial Reform and Accountability**: From community policing to sentencing and incarceration, data and technology has a role to play in the fight for racial equality.

**Diverse Representation**: Bias and misrepresentation are commonplace throughout society and business. These projects serve to address these issues and strive for representation at every level.

**Policy & Legislation Reform**: Policy and legislation needs more inclusion from the communities it impacts. This requires better visibility into the creation process and more opportunities for feedback.

Call for Code for Racial Justice is part of the broader Call for Code tech-for-good initiative in which more than 400,000 developers and problem solvers across 179 nations have participated since launch in 2018 to address problems such as climate change and COVID-19 with open source-powered software.
